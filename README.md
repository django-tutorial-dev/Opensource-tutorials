## DO NOT REMOVE THE GITIGNORE,CONTRIBUTING,README & OTHER'S CONTENTS
### Contribution Guidelines

1. **Create a Folder for Each Tutorial/Documentation**  
   - For each new topic or Django-specific concept, create a new folder named after the tutorial or topic.
   - Within this folder, create a `main.html` file where you will place the content for the main topic.
   
   **Example:**
```
tutorials/
â””â”€â”€ views/
    â”œâ”€â”€ main.html  # Main topic (Views in Django)
    â”œâ”€â”€ function-based.html  # Subtopic: Function-based Views
    â””â”€â”€ class-based.html  # Subtopic: Class-based Views
```

3. **Organizing Subtopics**  
- If your tutorial or documentation has subtopics, create multiple `.html` files for each subtopic inside the same folder.
- Ensure that each subtopic file is descriptive and follows the naming format: `<name-of-subtopic>.html`.
- Link the subtopic `.html` files from the `main.html` file for easy navigation.

3. **Markdown for Readability**  
- If you'd like to include Markdown for ease of readability and formatting before converting to HTML, ensure that you use it properly. Tools such as Markdown to HTML converters can help with this process.

### Code Style and Content Requirements

- Use **simple language** and **clear explanations** to help new developers understand complex concepts.
- Where possible, link to relevant official Django documentation to support your explanations.
- Include **code snippets** inside `<code>` tags, ensuring they are properly indented and easy to follow.
- Avoid advanced jargon unless it's essential to the topic, and provide explanations for any technical terms.
